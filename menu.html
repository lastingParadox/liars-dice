                    All players have their dice rolled separately, then each player, starting from the first player, claims how many dice of a face were rolled across the table. 
                    After a claim is made, the next person can either claim or challenge the previous claim. 
                    If the person chooses to claim, the new claim must be higher in the amount of dice, higher in the face value of the dice, or higher in the amount of dice and a change in the face value of the dice. 
                    If the person chooses to challenge, then all dice on the table are shown. If the claim happened to be true, the claimant gets a point. If the claim happened to be false, then the challenger gets a point. 
                    Game ends when a player accumulates three points.
